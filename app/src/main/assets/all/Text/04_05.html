	  <p><strong>4.4 Pseudo First Order Reaction</strong></p>
  <p>The order of a reaction is sometimes altered by conditions. Consider a chemical reaction between two substances when one reactant is present in large excess. During the hydrolysis of 0.01 mol of ethyl acetate with 10 mol of water, amounts of the various constituents at the beginning (t = 0) and completion (t) of the reaction are given as under.</p>
  <p>CH3COOC2H5 + H2O <img alt="3272.png" src="../Images4/3272.png"> CH3COOH + C2H5OH</p>
  <p>t = 0 0.01 mol 10 mol 0 mol 0 mol</p>
  <p>t 0 mol 9.9 mol 0.01 mol 0.01 mol</p>
  <p>The concentration of water does not get altered much during the course of the reaction. So, in the rate equation</p>
  <p>Rate = k′ [CH3COOC2H5] [H2O]</p>
  <p>the term [H2O] can be taken as constant. The equation, thus, becomes</p>
  <p>Rate = k [CH3COOC2H5]</p>
  <p>where k = k′ [H2O]</p>
  <p>and the reaction behaves as first order reaction. Such reactions are called pseudo first order reactions. Inversion of cane sugar is another pseudo first order reaction.</p>
  <p>C12H22O11 + H2O <img alt="3281.png" src="../Images4/3281.png"> C6H12O6 + C6H12O6</p>
  <p>Cane sugar Glucose Fructose</p>
  <p>Rate = k [C12H22O11]</p>
  <p><strong>Example 4.9</strong></p>
  <p>Hydrolysis of methyl acetate in aqueous solution has been studied by titrating the liberated acetic acid against sodium hydroxide. The concentration of the ester at different times is given below.</p>

  <p>Show that it follows a pseudo first order reaction, as the concentration of water remains nearly constant (55 mol L–1), during the course of the reaction. What is the value of k′ in this equation?</p>
  <p><br>
  Rate = k′ [CH3COOCH3][H2O]</p>
  <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
  <p>For pseudo first order reaction, the reaction should be first order with respect to ester when [H2O] is constant. The rate constant k for pseudo first order reaction is</p>

  <p>It can be seen that k´ [H2O] is constant and equal to 2.004 × 10-3 min–1 and hence, it is pseudo first order reaction. We can now determine k from</p>
  <p>k´ [H2O] = 2.004 × 10–3 min–1</p>
  <p><br>
  k´ [55 mol L–1] = 2.004 × 10–3 min–1</p>
  <p><br>
  k´ = 3.64 × 10–5 moL–1 L min–1</p>
