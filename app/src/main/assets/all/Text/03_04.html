	  <h2>3.4 Conductance of Electrolytic Solutions</h2>
  <p>It is necessary to define a few terms before we consider the subject of conductance of electricity through electrolytic solutions. The electrical resistance is represented by the symbol&nbsp;‘R’&nbsp;and it is measured in ohm (Ω) which in terms of SI base units is equal to (kg m2)/(S3&nbsp;A2). It can be measured with the help of a Wheatstone bridge with which you are familiar from your study of physics. The electrical resistance of any object is directly proportional to its length,&nbsp;l, and inversely proportional to its area of cross section,&nbsp;A. That is,<br></p>
  <p>R ∝ <img alt="51" src="../Images3/51.png"> or R = ρ <img alt="51" src="../Images3/51.png"> (3.17)</p>
  <p>The constant of proportionality, ρ (Greek, rho), is called resistivity (specific resistance). Its SI units are ohm metre (Ω m) and quite often its submultiple, ohm centimetre (Ω cm) is also used. IUPAC recommends the use of the term resistivity over specific resistance and hence in the rest of the book we shall use the term resistivity. Physically, the resistivity for a substance is its resistance when it is one metre long and its area of cross section is one m2. It can be seen that:</p>
  <p>1 Ω m = 100 Ω cm or 1 Ω cm = 0.01 Ω m</p>
  <p>The inverse of resistance, R, is called conductance, G, and we have the relation:</p>
  <p>G = <img alt="53" src="../Images3/53.png">= <img alt="54" src="../Images3/54.png"> (3.18)</p>
  <p>The SI unit of conductance is siemens, represented by the symbol ‘S’ and is equal to ohm–1 (also known as mho) or Ω–1. The inverse of resistivity, called conductivity (specific conductance) is represented by the symbol, κ (Greek, kappa). IUPAC has recommended the use of term conductivity over specific conductance and hence we shall use the term conductivity in the rest of the book. The SI units of conductivity are<br>
  S m–1 but quite often, κ is expressed in S cm–1. Conductivity of a material in S m–1 is its conductance when it is 1 m long and its area of cross section is 1 m2. It may be noted that 1 S cm–1 = 100 S m–1.</p>

  <p>It can be seen from Table 3.2 that the magnitude of conductivity varies a great deal and depends on the nature of the material. It also depends on the temperature and pressure at which the measurements are made. Materials are classified into conductors, insulators and semiconductors depending on the magnitude of their conductivity. Metals and their alloys have very large conductivity and are known as conductors. Certain non-metals like carbon-black, graphite and some organic polymers* are also electronically conducting. Substances like glass, ceramics, etc., having very low conductivity are known as insulators. Substances like silicon, doped silicon and gallium arsenide having conductivity between conductors and insulators are called semiconductors and are important electronic materials. Certain materials called superconductors by definition have zero resistivity or infinite conductivity. Earlier, only metals and their alloys at very low temperatures (0 to 15 K) were known to behave as superconductors, but nowadays a number of ceramic materials and mixed oxides are also known to show superconductivity at temperatures as high as 150 K.</p>
  <p>Electrical conductance through metals is called metallic or electronic conductance and is due to the movement of electrons. The electronic conductance depends on</p>
  <p>(i) the nature and structure of the metal</p>
  <p>(ii) the number of valence electrons per atom</p>
  <p>(iii) temperature (it decreases with increase of temperature).</p>

  <h4>* Electronically conducting polymers – In 1977 MacDiarmid, Heeger and Shirakawa discovered that acetylene gas can be polymerised to produce a polymer, polyacetylene when exposed to vapours of iodine acquires metallic lustre and conductivity. Since then several organic conducting polymers have been made such as polyaniline, polypyrrole and polythiophene. These organic metals, being composed wholly of elements like carbon, hydrogen and occasionally nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur, are much lighter than normal metals and can be used for making light-weight batteries. Besides, they have the mechanical properties of polymers such as flexibility so that one can make electronic devices such as transistors that can bend like a sheet of plastic. For the discovery of conducting polymers, MacDiarmid, Heeger and Shirakawa were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the year 2000.</h4>
  <hr>
  <p>As the electrons enter at one end and go out through the other end, the composition of the metallic conductor remains unchanged. The mechanism of conductance through semiconductors is more complex.<br></p>
  <p>We already know (Class XI, Unit 7) that even very pure water has small amounts of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions (~10–7M) which lend it very low conductivity (3.5 × 10–5 S m–1). When electrolytes are dissolved in water, they furnish their own ions in the solution hence its conductivity also increases. The conductance of electricity by ions present in the solutions is called electrolytic or ionic conductance. The conductivity of electrolytic (ionic) solutions depends on:</p>
  <p>(i) the nature of the electrolyte added</p>
  <p>(ii) size of the ions produced and their solvation</p>
  <p>(iii) the nature of the solvent and its viscosity</p>
  <p>(iv) concentration of the electrolyte</p>
  <p>(v) temperature (it increases with the increase of temperature).</p>
  <p>Passage of direct current through ionic solution over a prolonged period can lead to change in its composition due to electrochemical reactions (Section 3.4.1).</p>
  <h3>3.4.1 Measurement of the Conductivity of Ionic Solutions</h3>
  <p>We know that accurate measurement of an unknown resistance can be performed on a Wheatstone bridge. However, for measuring the resistance of an ionic solution we face two problems. Firstly, passing direct current (DC) changes the composition of the solution. Secondly, a solution cannot be connected to the bridge like a metallic wire or other solid conductor. The first difficulty is resolved by using an alternating current (AC) source of power. The second problem is solved by using a specially designed vessel called conductivity cell. It is available in several designs and two simple ones are shown in Fig. 3.4.</p><img alt="Fig" src="../Images3/Fig._3.4.png">
  <h4>Fig. 3.4&nbsp;Two different types of conductivity cells.</h4>
  <p>Basically it consists of two platinum electrodes coated with platinum black (finely divided metallic Pt is deposited on the electrodes electrochemically). These have area of cross section equal to ‘A’ and are separated by distance ‘l’. Therefore, solution confined between these electrodes is a column of length l and area of cross section A. The resistance of such a column of solution is then given by the equation:</p>
  <p>R = ρ <img alt="60" src="../Images3/60.png">= <img alt="61" src="../Images3/61.png"> (3.17)</p>
  <p>The quantity l/A is called cell constant denoted by the symbol, G*. It depends on the distance between the electrodes and their area of cross-section and has the dimension of length–1 and can be calculated if we know l and A. Measurement of l and A is not only inconvenient but also unreliable. The cell constant is usually determined by measuring the resistance of the cell containing a solution whose conductivity is already known. For this purpose, we generally use KCl solutions whose conductivity is known accurately at various concentrations (Table 3.3) and at different temperatures. The cell constant, G*, is then given by the equation:</p>
  <p>G* =&nbsp;<img alt="60" src="../Images3/60.png">&nbsp;= R&nbsp;κ&nbsp;(3.18)<br></p><br>
  <p><strong>Table 3.3: Conductivity and Molar conductivity of KCl solutions at 298.15K</strong></p>
  <p><img alt="che3" src="../Images3/che3.png"></p>
  <p>Once the cell constant is determined, we can use it for measuring the resistance or conductivity of any solution. The set up for the measurement of the resistance is shown in Fig. 3.5.</p>
  <p><img alt="Fig" src="../Images3/Fig._3.5.png"></p>
  <h4>Fig. 3.5:&nbsp;Arrangement for measurement of resistance of a solution of an electrolyte.<br></h4>
  <p>It consists of two resistances R3 and R4, a variable resistance R1 and the conductivity cell having the unknown resistance R2. The Wheatstone bridge is fed by an oscillator O (a source of a.c. power in the audio frequency range 550 to 5000 cycles per second). P is a suitable detector (a headphone or other electronic device) and the bridge is balanced when no current passes through the detector. Under these conditions:</p>
  <p>Unknown resistance R2 = <img alt="68" src="../Images3/68.png"> (3.19)</p>
  <p>These days, inexpensive conductivity meters are available which can directly read the conductance or resistance of the solution in the conductivity cell. Once the cell constant and the resistance of the solution in the cell is determined, the conductivity of the solution is given by the equation:</p>
  <p><img alt="69" src="../Images3/69.png"> (3.20)</p>
  <p>The conductivity of solutions of different electrolytes in the same solvent and at a given temperature differs due to charge and size of the ions in which they dissociate, the concentration of ions or ease with which the ions move under a potential gradient. It, therefore, becomes necessary to define a physically more meaningful quantity called molar conductivity denoted by the symbol Λm (Greek, lambda). It is related to the conductivity of the solution by the equation:</p>
  <p>Molar conductivity = Λm = <img alt="70" src="../Images3/70.png"> (3.21)</p>
  <p>In the above equation, if κ is expressed in S m–1 and the concentration, c in mol m–3 then the units of Λm are in S m2 mol–1. It may be noted that:</p>
  <p>1 mol m–3 = 1000(L/m3) × molarity (mol/L), and hence</p>
  <p>Λm(S cm2 mol–1) = <img alt="71" src="../Images3/71.png"></p>
  <p>If we use S cm–1 as the units for κ and mol cm–3, the units of concentration, then the units for Λm are S cm2 mol–1. It can be calculated by using the equation:</p>
  <p>Λm(S cm2 mol–1) = <img alt="72" src="../Images3/72.png"></p>
  <p>Both type of units are used in literature and are related to each other by the equations:</p>
  <p>1 S m2mol–1 = 104 S cm2mol–1 or</p>
  <p>1 S cm2mol–1 = 10–4 S m2mol–1.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p><strong>Example 3.4</strong></p>
  <p>Resistance of a conductivity cell filled with 0.1 mol L–1&nbsp;KCl solution is&nbsp;100&nbsp;Ω. If the resistance of the same cell when filled with 0.02 mol L–1&nbsp;KCl solution is 520&nbsp;Ω, calculate the conductivity and molar conductivity of 0.02 mol L–1&nbsp;KCl solution. The conductivity of 0.1 mol L–1&nbsp;KCl solution is 1.29 S/m.<br></p>
  <p><strong>Solution</strong><br></p>
  <p>The cell constant is given by the equation:</p>
  <p>Cell constant =&nbsp;G*&nbsp;= conductivity × resistance</p>
  <p>= 1.29 S/m × 100&nbsp;Ω&nbsp;= 129 m–1&nbsp;= 1.29 cm–1</p>

  <h3>3.4.2&nbsp;Variation of Conductivity and Molar Conductivity with Concentration<br></h3>
  <p>Both conductivity and molar conductivity change with the concentration of the electrolyte. Conductivity always decreases with decrease in concentration both, for weak and strong electrolytes. This can be explained by the fact that the number of ions per unit volume that carry the current in&nbsp;a solution decreases on dilution. The conductivity of a solution at any given concentration is the conductance of one unit volume of solution kept between two platinum electrodes with unit area of cross section and at a distance of unit length. This is clear from the equation:</p>
  <p><img alt="73" src="../Images3/73.png"> (both A and l are unity in their appropriate units in m or cm)</p>
  <p>Molar conductivity of a solution at a given concentration is the conductance of the volume V of solution containing one mole of electrolyte kept between two electrodes with area of cross section A and distance of unit length. Therefore,</p>
  <p><img alt="74" src="../Images3/74.png"></p>
  <p>Since&nbsp;l =&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;A&nbsp;=&nbsp;V&nbsp;( volume containing 1 mole of electrolyte)</p>
  <p>Λm&nbsp;=&nbsp;κ&nbsp;V&nbsp;(3.22)</p><img alt="3" src="../Images3/3.8_eps-8.png">
  <h4>Fig. 3.6: Molar conductivity versus c½ for acetic acid (weak electrolyte) and potassium chloride (strong electrolyte) in aqueous solutions.</h4>
  <p>Molar conductivity increases with decrease in concentration. This is because the total volume, V, of solution containing one mole of electrolyte also increases. It has been found that decrease in κ on dilution of a solution is more than compensated by increase in its volume. Physically, it means that at a given concentration, Λm can be defined as the conductance of the electrolytic solution kept between the electrodes of a conductivity cell at unit distance but having area of cross section large enough to accommodate sufficient volume of solution that contains one mole of the electrolyte. When concentration approaches zero, the molar conductivity is known as limiting molar conductivity and is represented by the symbol Λ°m. The variation in Λm with concentration is different (Fig. 3.6) for strong and weak electrolytes.</p>
  <h3>Strong Electrolytes</h3>
  <p>For strong electrolytes, Λm increases slowly with dilution and can be represented by the equation:</p>
  <p>Λm = Λm ° – A c ½ (3.23)</p>
  <p>It can be seen that if we plot (Fig. 3.12) Λm against&nbsp;c1/2, we obtain a straight line with intercept equal to Λm ° and slope equal to ‘–A’. The value of the constant ‘A’ for a given solvent and temperature depends on the type of electrolyte i.e., the charges on the cation and anion produced on the dissociation of the electrolyte in the solution. Thus, NaCl, CaCl2, MgSO4 are known as 1-1, 2-1 and 2-2 electrolytes respectively. All electrolytes of a particular type have the same value for ‘A’.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 3.6</strong></p>
  <p>The molar conductivity of KCl solutions at different concentrations at</p>
  <p>298 K are given below:</p>
  <p>c/mol L–1&nbsp;Λm/S cm2&nbsp;mol–1</p>
  <p>0.000198 148.61</p>
  <p>0.000309 148.29</p>
  <p>0.000521 147.81</p>
  <p>0.000989 147.09</p>
  <p>Show that a plot between&nbsp;Λm&nbsp;and&nbsp;c1/2&nbsp;is a straight line. Determine the values of&nbsp;Λm&nbsp;°&nbsp;and A for KCl.</p>
  <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
  <p>Taking the square root of concentration we obtain:</p>
  <p>c1/2/(mol L–1&nbsp;)1/2&nbsp;Λm/S cm2mol–1</p>
  <p>0.01407 148.61</p>
  <p>0.01758 148.29</p>
  <p>0.02283 147.81</p>
  <p>0.03145 147.09</p>
  <p>A plot of&nbsp;Λm( y-axis) and c1/2&nbsp;(x-axis) is shown in (Fig. 3.7).</p>
  <p>It can be seen that it is nearly a straight line. From the intercept<br>
  (c1/2&nbsp;= 0), we find that</p>
  <p>Λm&nbsp;°= 150.0 S cm2&nbsp;mol–1&nbsp;and</p>
  <p>A&nbsp;= – slope = 87.46 S cm2&nbsp;mol–1/(mol/L–1)1/2.</p><img alt="3" src="../Images3/3.9a_eps-8.png">
  <h4>Fig. 3.7:&nbsp;Variation of&nbsp;Λm&nbsp;against c½.</h4>
  <p>Kohlrausch examined <img alt="ch1" src="../Images3/ch1.png">values for a number of strong electrolytes and observed certain regularities. He noted that the difference in <img alt="ch1" src="../Images3/ch1.png"> of the electrolytes NaX and KX for any X is nearly constant. For example at 298 K:</p>
  <p><img alt="ch1" src="../Images3/ch1.png"> (KCl) – <img alt="ch1" src="../Images3/ch1.png"> (NaCl)= <img alt="ch1" src="../Images3/ch1.png"> (KBr) – <img alt="ch1" src="../Images3/ch1.png"> (NaBr)</p>
  <p>= <img alt="ch1" src="../Images3/ch1.png"> (KI) – <img alt="ch1" src="../Images3/ch1.png"> (NaI) Y 23.4 S cm2 mol–1</p>
  <p>and similarly it was found that</p>
  <p><img alt="ch1" src="../Images3/ch1.png"> (NaBr)– <img alt="ch1" src="../Images3/ch1.png"> (NaCl)= <img alt="ch1" src="../Images3/ch1.png"> (KBr) – <img alt="ch1" src="../Images3/ch1.png"> (KCl) Y 1.8 S cm2 mol–1</p>
  <p>On the basis of the above observations he enunciated Kohlrausch law of independent migration of ions. The law states that limiting molar conductivity of an electrolyte can be represented as the sum of the individual contributions of the anion and cation of the electrolyte. Thus, if λ°Na+ and λ°Cl– are limiting molar conductivity of the sodium and chloride ions respectively, then the limiting molar conductivity for sodium chloride is given by the equation:</p>
  <p><img alt="ch1" src="../Images3/ch1.png"> (NaCl) = λ0Na+ + λ0Cl– (3.24)</p>
  <p>In general, if an electrolyte on dissociation gives ν+ cations and ν– anions then its limiting molar conductivity is given by:</p>
  <p><img alt="ch1" src="../Images3/ch1.png"> = ν+ λ0+ + ν– λ0– (3.25)</p>
  <p>Here, <img alt="75" src="../Images3/75.png"> and <img alt="76" src="../Images3/76.png"> are the limiting molar conductivities of the cation and anion respectively. The values of λ0 for some cations and anions at 298 K are given in Table 3.4.</p>
  <p><strong>Table 3.4: Limiting Molar Conductivity for some Ions in Water at 298 K</strong><br></p>
  <p><img alt="che5" src="../Images3/che5.png"><br></p>
  <h3>Weak Electrolytes</h3>
  <p>Weak electrolytes like acetic acid have lower degree of dissociation at higher concentrations and hence for such electrolytes, the change in Λm with dilution is due to increase in the degree of dissociation and consequently the number of ions in total volume of solution that contains 1 mol of electrolyte. In such cases Λm increases steeply (Fig. 3.12) on dilution, especially near lower concentrations. Therefore, <img alt="ch1" src="../Images3/ch1.png"> cannot be obtained by extrapolation of Λm to zero concentration. At infinite dilution (i.e., concentration c → zero) electrolyte dissociates completely (α =1), but at such low concentration the conductivity of the solution is so low that it cannot be measured accurately. Therefore, <img alt="ch1" src="../Images3/ch1.png"> for weak electrolytes is obtained by using Kohlrausch law of independent migration of ions (Example 3.8). At any concentration c, if α is the degree of dissociation then it can be approximated to the ratio of molar conductivity Λm at the concentration c to limiting molar conductivity, <img alt="ch1" src="../Images3/ch1.png">. Thus we have:</p>
  <p><img alt="78" src="../Images3/78.png"> (3.26)</p>
  <p>But we know that for a weak electrolyte like acetic acid (Class XI, Unit 7),</p>
  <p><img alt="79" src="../Images3/79.png"> (3.27)</p>
  <h3>Applications of Kohlrausch law</h3>
  <p>Using Kohlrausch law of independent migration of ions, it is possible to calculate <img alt="ch1" src="../Images3/ch1.png"> for any electrolyte from the λo of individual ions. Moreover, for weak electrolytes like acetic acid it is possible to determine the value of its dissociation constant once we know the <img alt="ch1" src="../Images3/ch1.png"> and Λm at a given concentration c.</p>

  <p>Calculate <img alt="ch1" src="../Images3/ch1.png"> for CaCl2 and MgSO4 from the data given in Table 3.4.</p>
