	  <h6><strong>14.4.1 Classification of Vitamins</strong></h6>
  <p>Vitamins are classified into two groups depending upon their solubility in water or fat.</p>
  <p><br>
  (i) Fat soluble vitamins: Vitamins which are soluble in fat and oils but insoluble in water are kept in this group. These are vitamins A, D, E and K. They are stored in liver and adipose (fat storing) tissues.</p>(ii) Water soluble vitamins: B group vitamins and vitamin C are soluble in water so they are grouped together. Water soluble vitamins must be supplied regularly in diet because they are readily excreted in urine and cannot be stored (except vitamin B12) in our body.
  <p><br>
  Some important vitamins, their sources and diseases caused by their deficiency are listed in Table 14.3.</p>
