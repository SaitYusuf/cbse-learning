	<p>Diversity in chemistry is the hallmark of p–block elements manifested in their ability to react with the elements of s–, d– and f–blocks as well as with their own.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>In Class XI, you have learnt that the p-block elements are placed in groups 13 to 18 of the periodic table. Their valence shell electronic configuration is ns2np1–6 (except He which has 1s2 configuration). The properties of p-block elements like that of others are greatly influenced by atomic sizes, ionisation enthalpy, electron gain enthalpy and electronegativity. The absence of d-orbitals in second period and presence of d or d and f orbitals in heavier elements (starting from third period onwards) have significant effects on the properties of elements. In addition, the presence of all the three types of elements; metals, metalloids and non-metals bring diversification in chemistry of these elements.</p>
  <p>Having learnt the chemistry of elements of Groups 13 and 14 of the p-block of periodic table in Class XI, you will learn the chemistry of the elements of subsequent groups in this Unit.</p>
