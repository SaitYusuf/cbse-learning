	  <p><strong>6.6 Oxidation Reduction</strong></p>
  <p>Besides reductions, some extractions are based on oxidation particularly for non-metals. A very common example of extraction based on oxidation is the extraction of chlorine from brine (chlorine is abundant in sea water as common salt) .</p>
  <p><br>
  2Cl–(aq) + 2H2O(l) → 2OH–(aq) + H2(g) + Cl2(g) (6.49)</p>
  <p><br>
  The ΔG for this reaction is + 422 kJ. When it is converted to E0 (using ΔG = – nEF), we get E = – 2.2 V. Naturally, it will require an external e.m.f. that is greater than 2.2 V. But the electrolysis requires an excess potential to overcome some other hindering reactions. Thus, Cl2 is obtained by electrolysis giving out H2 and aqueous NaOH as byproducts. Electrolysis of molten NaCl is also carried out. But in that case, Na metal is produced and not NaOH.</p>
  <p>As studied earlier, extraction of gold and silver involves leaching the metal with CN–. This is also an oxidation reaction (Ag → Ag+ or Au → Au+). The metal is later recovered by displacement method.</p>
  <p><br>
  4Au(s) + 8CN–(aq) + 2H2O(aq) + O2(g) → 4[Au(CN)2]–(aq) + 4OH–(aq) (6.50)</p>
  <p><br>
  2[Au(CN)2]–(aq) + Zn(s) → 2Au(s) + [Zn(CN)4]2– (aq) (6.51)</p>
  <p>In this reaction zinc acts as a reducing agent.</p>
