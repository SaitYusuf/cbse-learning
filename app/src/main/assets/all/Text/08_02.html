	  <h4>8.2 Electronic Configurations of the d-Block Elements</h4><br>
  <p>In general the electronic configuration of these elements is&nbsp;(n-1)d1–10ns1–2. &nbsp;The (n–1) stands for the inner d orbitals which may have one to ten electrons and the outermost ns orbital may have one or two electrons. However, this generalisation has several exceptions because of very little energy difference between (n-1)d and ns orbitals. Furthermore, half and completely filled sets of orbitals are relatively more stable. A consequence of this factor is reflected in the electronic configurations of Cr and Cu in the 3d series. Consider the case of Cr, for example, which has 3d54s1 instead of 3d44s2; the energy gap between the two sets (3d and 4s) of orbitals is small enough to prevent electron entering the 3d orbitals. Similarly in case of Cu, the configuration is 3d104s1 and not 3d94s2. The outer electronic configurations of the transition elements are given in Table 8.1.</p>

  <p>The electronic configurations of Zn, Cd and Hg are represented by the general formula (n-1)d10ns2. The orbitals in these elements are completely filled in the ground state as well as in their common oxidation states. Therefore, they are not regarded as transition elements.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>The d orbitals of the transition elements project to the periphery of an atom more than the other orbitals (i.e., s and p), hence, they are more influenced by the surroundings as well as affecting the atoms or molecules surrounding them. In some respects, ions of a given dn configuration (n = 1 – 9) have similar magnetic and electronic properties. With partly filled d orbitals these elements exhibit certain characteristic properties such as display of a variety of oxidation states, formation of coloured ions and entering into complex formation with a variety of ligands.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>The transition metals and their compounds also exhibit catalytic property and paramagnetic behaviour. All these characteristics have been discussed in detail later in this Unit.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>There are greater horizontal similarities in the properties of the transition elements in contrast to the main group elements. However, some group similarities also exist. We shall first study the general characteristics and their trends in the horizontal rows (particularly 3d row) and then consider some group similarities.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p><i><strong>Example 8.1</strong></i></p>
  <p>On what ground can you say that scandium (Z = 21) is a transition element but zinc (Z = 30) is not?</p>
  <p><i><strong>Solution</strong></i></p>
  <p>On the basis of incompletely filled 3d orbitals in case of scandium atom in its ground state (3d1), it is regarded as a transition element. On the other hand, zinc atom has completely filled d orbitals (3d10) in its ground state as well as in its oxidised state, hence it is not regarded as a transition element.</p>
