	  <h3>Number of Atoms in a Unit Cell</h3>
  <p>We know that any crystal lattice is made up of a very large number of unit cells and every lattice point is occupied by one constituent particle (atom, molecule or ion). Let us now work out what portion of each particle belongs to a particular unit cell.</p>
  <p>We shall consider three types of cubic unit cells and for simplicity assume that the constituent particle is an atom.</p>
  <p><strong><br></strong></p>
  <h4>Primitive Cubic Unit Cell</h4>
  Primitive cubic unit cell has atoms only at its corner. Each atom at a corner is shared between eight adjacent unit cells, four unit cells in the same layer and four unit cells of the upper (or lower) layer. Therefore, only <img alt="3791.png" src="../Images/3791.png">th of an atom (or molecule or ion) actually belongs to a&nbsp;<br>
  particular unit cell. In the figure below, a primitive cubic unit cell has been depicted in three different ways. Each small sphere in figure (a) represents only the centre of the particle occupying that position and not its actual size. Such structures are called open structures. The arrangement of particles is easier to follow in open structures.<br>
  figure (b) depicts space-filling representation of the unit cell with actual particle size and figure (c) shows the actual portions of different atoms present in a cubic unit cell. In all, since each cubic unit cell has 8 atoms on its corners, the total number of atoms in one unit cell is <img alt="3796.png" src="../Images/3796.png"> atom.

  <p><strong><br></strong></p>
  <h4>Body-Centred Cubic Unit Cell</h4>
  <p>A body-centred cubic (bcc) unit cell has an atom at each of its corners and also one atom at its body centre. It can be seen that the atom at the body centre wholly belongs to the unit cell in which it is present. Thus in a body-centered cubic (bcc) unit cell:</p>

  <p class="caption">A body-centred cubic unit cell (a) open structure (b) spacefilling structure (c) actual portions of atoms belonging to one unit cell.</p>
  <p>(i) 8 corners × <img alt="3801.png" src="../Images/3801.png"> per corner atom <img alt="3806.png" src="../Images/3806.png"> = 1 atom</p>
  <p>(ii) 1 body centre atom = 1 × 1 = 1 atom</p>
  <p>∴ Total number of atoms per unit cell = 2 atoms</p>
  <p><strong><br></strong></p>
  <h4>Face- Centred Cubic Unit Cell</h4>
  <p>A face-centred cubic (fcc) unit cell contains atoms at all the corners and at the centre of all the faces of the cube. It can be seen in Fig. 1.11 that each atom located at the face-centre is shared between two adjacent unit cells and only <img alt="3811.png" src="../Images/3811.png">of each atom belongs to a unit cell. Fig. 1.12 depicts (a) open structure (b) space-filling model and (c) the unit cell with portions of atoms actually belonging to it. Thus, in a face-centred cubic (fcc) unit cell:</p>
  <p>(i) 8 corners atoms × <img alt="3816.png" src="../Images/3816.png"> atom per unit cell <img alt="3821.png" src="../Images/3821.png"> = 1 atom</p>
  <p>(ii) 6 face-centred atoms × <img alt="3826.png" src="../Images/3826.png"> atom per unit cell = 6 × <img alt="3831.png" src="../Images/3831.png"> = 3 atoms</p>
  <p>∴ Total number of atoms per unit cell = 4 atoms</p>
