	  <p><i>Iron, copper, silver and gold are among the transition elements that have played important roles in the development of human civilisation. The inner transition elements such as Th, Pa and U are proving excellent sources of nuclear energy in modern times.</i></p><br>
  <p>The d-block of the periodic table contains the elements of the groups 3-12 in which the d orbitals are progressively filled in each of the four long periods. The elements constituting the f -block are those in which the 4 f and 5 f orbitals are progressively filled in the latter two long periods; these elements are formal members of group 3 from which they have been taken out to form a separate f-block of the periodic table. The names <i>transition metals and inner transition</i> <i>metals</i> are often used to refer to the elements of d-and f-blocks respectively.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>There are mainly three series of the transition metals, 3d series (Sc to Zn), 4d series (Y to Cd) and 5d series (La to Hg, omitting Ce to Lu). The fourth 6d series which begins with Ac is still incomplete. The two series of the inner transition metals, (4f and 5f) are known as <i>lanthanoids</i> and <i>actinoids</i> respectively.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>Strictly speaking, a transition element is defined as the one which has incompletely filled d orbitals in its ground state or in any one of its oxidation states. Zinc, cadmium and mercury of group 12 have full d10 configuration in their ground state as well as in their common oxidation states and hence, are not regarded as transition metals. However, being the end members of the three transition series, their chemistry is studied along with the chemistry of the transition metals.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>The presence of partly filled <i>d</i> or <i>f</i> orbitals in their atoms sets the study of the transition elements and their compounds apart from that of the main group elements. However, the usual theory of valence as applicable to the main group elements can also be applied successfully to the transition elements.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>Various precious metals such as silver, gold and platinum and industrially important metals like iron, copper and titanium form part of the transition metals.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>In this Unit, besides introduction, we shall first deal with the electronic configuration, occurrence and general characteristics of the transition elements with special emphasis on the trends in the properties of the first row (3d) transition metals and the preparation and properties of some important compounds. This will be followed by consideration of certain general aspects such as electronic configurations, oxidation states and chemical reactivity of the inner transition metals.</p>

  <h4>8.1 Position in the Periodic Table</h4><br>
  <p><strong>THE TRANSITION ELEMENTS (d-BLOCK)</strong></p>
  <p>The d–block occupies the large middle section flanked by s– and&nbsp;p– blocks in the periodic table. The very name ‘transition’ given to the elements of d-block is only because of their position between s– and p– block elements. The d–orbitals of the penultimate energy level in their atoms receive electrons giving rise to the three rows of the transition metals, i.e., 3d, 4d and 5d. The fourth row of 6d is still incomplete. These series of the transition elements are shown in Table 8.1.</p>
