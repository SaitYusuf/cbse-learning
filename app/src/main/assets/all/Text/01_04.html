	  <h3>Crystal Lattices and Unit Cells</h3>

  <p>The main characteristic of crystalline solids is a regular and repeating pattern of constituent particles. If the three dimensional arrangement of constituent particles in a crystal is represented diagrammatically, in which each particle is depicted as a point, the arrangement is called crystal lattice. Thus, a regular three dimensional arrangement of points in space is called a crystal lattice.</p>

  <p>There are only 14 possible three dimensional lattices. These are called Bravais Lattices (after the French mathematician who first described them). The following are the characteristics of a crystal lattice:</p>
  <p><b>(a)</b> Each point in a lattice is called lattice point or lattice site.</p>
  <p><b>(b)</b> Each point in a crystal lattice represents one constituent particle which may be an atom, a molecule (group of atoms) or an ion.</p>
  <p><b>(c)</b> Lattice points are joined by straight lines to bring out the geometry of the lattice. Unit cell is the smallest portion of a crystal lattice which, when repeated in different directions, generates the entire lattice.</p>
  <p>A unit cell is characterised by:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>
  <p>Its dimensions along the three edges, a, b and c. These edges may or may not be mutually perpendicular.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p>The angles between the edges, α (between b and c) β (between a and c) and γ (between a and b). Thus, a unit cell is characterised by six parameters, a, b, c, α, β and γ.</p></li>

  <h4>Primitive and Centred Unit Cells</h4>
  <p>Unit cells can be broadly divided into two categories, primitive and centred unit cells.</p>
  <h5>Primitive Unit Cells</h5>
  <p>When constituent particles are present only on the corner positions of a unit cell, it is called as primitive unit cell.</p>
  <h5>Centred Unit Cells</h5>
  <p>When a unit cell contains one or more constituent particles present at positions other than corners in addition to those at corners, it is called a centred unit cell. Centred unit cells are of three types:</p>
  <p>(i) <i>Body-Centred Unit Cells</i>: Such a unit cell contains one constituent particle (atom, molecule or ion) at its body-centre besides the ones that are at its corners.</p>
  <p>(ii) <i>Face-Centred Unit Cells</i>: Such a unit cell contains one constituent particle present at the centre of each face, besides the ones that are at its corners.</p>
  <p>(iii) <i>End-Centred Unit Cells</i>: In such a unit cell, one constituent particle is present at the centre of any two opposite faces besides the ones present at its corners.</p>
  <p>In all, there are seven types of primitive unit cells.</p>
