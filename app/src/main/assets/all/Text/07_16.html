	  <p><strong>7.15 Sulphur Dioxide</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>
  <p>Sulphur dioxide is formed together with a little (6-8%) sulphur trioxide when sulphur is burnt in air or oxygen:</p>
  <p>S(s) + O2(g) → SO2 (g)</p>
  <p>In the laboratory it is readily generated by treating a sulphite with dilute sulphuric acid.</p>
  <p>SO32-(aq) + 2H+ (aq) → H2O(l) + SO2 (g)</p>
  <p>Industrially, it is produced as a by-product of the roasting of sulphide ores.</p>

  <p>The gas after drying is liquefied under pressure and stored in steel cylinders.</p>
  <p><strong>Properties</strong></p>
  <p>Sulphur dioxide is a colourless gas with pungent smell and is highly soluble in water. It liquefies at room temperature under a pressure of two atmospheres and boils at 263 K.</p>
  <p>Sulphur dioxide, when passed through water, forms a solution of sulphurous acid.</p>

  <p>It reacts readily with sodium hydroxide solution, forming sodium sulphite, which then reacts with more sulphur dioxide to form sodium hydrogen sulphite.</p>
  <p>2NaOH + SO2 → Na2SO3 + H2O</p>
  <p>Na2SO3 + H2O + SO2 → 2NaHSO3</p>
  <p>In its reaction with water and alkalies, the behaviour of sulphur dioxide is very similar to that of carbon dioxide.</p>
  <p>Sulphur dioxide reacts with chlorine in the presence of charcoal (which acts as a catalyst) to give sulphuryl chloride, SO2Cl2. It is oxidised to sulphur trioxide by oxygen in the presence of vanadium(V) oxide catalyst.</p>
  <p>SO2(g) + Cl2 (g) → SO2Cl2(l)</p>

  <p>When moist, sulphur dioxide behaves as a reducing agent. For example, it converts iron(III) ions to iron(II) ions and decolourises acidified potassium permanganate(VII) solution; the latter reaction is a convenient test for the gas.</p>

  <p>The molecule of SO2 is angular. It is a resonance hybrid of the two canonical forms:</p>
  <p><strong>Uses:</strong> Sulphur dioxide is used (i) in refining petroleum and sugar (ii) in bleaching wool and silk and (iii) as an anti-chlor, disinfectant and preservative. Sulphuric acid, sodium hydrogen sulphite and calcium hydrogen sulphite (industrial chemicals) are manufactured from sulphur dioxide. Liquid SO2 is used as a solvent to dissolve a number of organic and inorganic chemicals.</p>
