  <p>The actinoids are radioactive elements and the earlier members have relatively long half-lives, the latter ones have half-life values ranging from a day to 3 minutes for lawrencium (Z =103). The latter members could be prepared only in nanogram quantities. These facts render their study more difficult.</p>
  <p><strong><br></strong></p>
  <p><strong><br></strong></p>
  <p><strong><br></strong></p>
  <h5><strong>8.6.1 Electronic Configurations</strong></h5><strong><br></strong>
  <p>All the actinoids are believed to have the electronic configuration of 7s2 and variable occupancy of the 5f and 6d subshells. The fourteen electrons are formally added to 5f, though not in thorium (Z = 90) but from Pa onwards the 5f orbitals are complete at element 103. The irregularities in the electronic configurations of the actinoids, like those in the lanthanoids are related to the stabilities of the f 0, f 7 and f 14 occupancies of the 5f orbitals. Thus, the configurations of Am and Cm are [Rn] 5f 77s2 and [Rn] 5f 76d17s2. Although the 5f orbitals resemble the 4f orbitals in their angular part of the wave-function, they are not as buried as 4f orbitals and hence 5f electrons can participate in bonding to a far greater extent.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p><strong><br></strong></p>
  <h5><strong><br></strong></h5>
  <h5><strong>8.6.2 Ionic Sizes</strong></h5><strong><br></strong> <strong><br></strong>
  <p>The general trend in lanthanoids is observable in the actinoids as well. There is a gradual decrease in the size of atoms or M3+ ions across the series. This may be referred to as the actinoid contraction (like lanthanoid contraction). The contraction is, however, greater from element to element in this series resulting from poor shielding by 5f electrons.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p><strong><br></strong></p>
  <h5><strong><br></strong></h5>
  <h5><strong>8.6.3 Oxidation States</strong></h5><strong><br></strong>
  <p>There is a greater range of oxidation states, which is in part attributed to the fact that the 5f, 6d and 7s levels are of comparable energies. The known oxidation states of actinoids are listed in Table 8.11.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>The actinoids show in general +3 oxidation state. The elements, in the first half of the series frequently exhibit higher oxidation states. For example, the maximum oxidation state increases from +4 in Th to +5, +6 and +7 respectively in Pa, U and Np but decreases in succeeding elements (Table 8.11). The actinoids resemble the lanthanoids in having more compounds in +3 state than in the +4 state. However, +3 and +4 ions tend to hydrolyse. Because the distribution of oxidation states among the actinoids is so uneven and so different for the former and later elements, it is unsatisfactory to review their chemistry in terms of oxidation states.</p>

  <h5><strong>8.6.4 General Characteristics and Comparison with Lanthanoids</strong></h5><strong><br></strong> <strong><br></strong> <strong><br></strong>
  <p>The actinoid metals are all silvery in appearance but display a variety of structures. The structural variability is obtained due to irregularities in metallic radii which are far greater than in lanthanoids.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>The actinoids are highly reactive metals, especially when finely divided. The action of boiling water on them, for example, gives a mixture of oxide and hydride and combination with most non metals takes place at moderate temperatures. Hydrochloric acid attacks all metals but most are slightly affected by nitric acid owing to the formation of protective oxide layers; alkalies have no action.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>The magnetic properties of the actinoids are more complex than those of the lanthanoids. Although the variation in the magnetic susceptibility of the actinoids with the number of unpaired 5 f electrons is roughly parallel to the corresponding results for the lanthanoids, the latter have higher values.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>It is evident from the behaviour of the actinoids that the ionisation enthalpies of the early actinoids, though not accurately known, but are lower than for the early lanthanoids. This is quite reasonable since it is to be expected that when 5f orbitals are beginning to be occupied, they will penetrate less into the inner core of electrons. The 5f electrons, will therefore, be more effectively shielded from the nuclear charge than the 4f electrons of the corresponding lanthanoids. Because the outer electrons are less firmly held, they are available for bonding in the actinoids.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>A comparison of the actinoids with the lanthanoids, with respect to different characteristics as discussed above, reveals that behaviour similar to that of the lanthanoids is not evident until the second half of the actinoid series. However, even the early actinoids resemble the lanthanoids in showing close similarities with each other and in gradual variation in properties which do not entail change in oxidation state. The lanthanoid and actinoid contractions, have extended effects on the sizes, and therefore, the properties of the elements succeeding them in their respective periods. The lanthanoid contraction is more important because the chemistry of elements succeeding the actinoids are much less known at the present time.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p><strong>Example 8.10</strong></p>
  <p>Name a member of the lanthanoid series which is well known to exhibit +4 oxidation state.</p>
