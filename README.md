# CBSE Learning: Reading & Quiz

A simple application that attempts to streamline the experience of studying for CBSE students.
- Native text. No PDFs. Split into easy to digest sections per chapter.
- Quizzes after every section covering the important parts to increase retention.
- Section scoring and which aggregates into chapter scoring based on quiz performance.

The plan was to develop this for all subjects within the CBSE syllabus.

However, I lost interest in developing anything within the traditional schooling system.
